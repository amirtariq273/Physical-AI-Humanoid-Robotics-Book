## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Enhanced the dark mode theme by increasing the intensity of neon glows on admonitions, code blocks, and primary buttons, and added a subtle glow effect to social icons on hover.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were run. Manual verification by starting Docusaurus server and using the theme toggle is required.
- 📁 Files: `frontend/src/css/custom.css` (modified).
- 🔁 Next prompts: User will verify the changes.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully applied specific visual adjustments to elevate the dark mode's "neon" aesthetic as requested.
