## Prompt

come in this section Key Modules & What You'll Learn

## Response snapshot

Successfully overwritten file: C:\Users\Aamir Tariq\Desktop\AI BOOK BY HUMAN\frontend\src\css\custom.css.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Implemented subtle yet impactful animations and hover effects across key UI elements (module cards, hero image) to further enhance the visual attraction and interactivity of the Docusaurus site.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were run. Manual verification by starting Docusaurus server is required.
- 📁 Files: `frontend/docs/intro.md` (modified), `frontend/src/css/custom.css` (modified).
- 🔁 Next prompts: User will verify the changes.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully addressed the user's request for "more attraction" by adding dynamic visual feedback to module cards and the hero image, integrating these into the existing theme.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): 
- Prompt variant (if applicable): 
- Next experiment (smallest change to try):
