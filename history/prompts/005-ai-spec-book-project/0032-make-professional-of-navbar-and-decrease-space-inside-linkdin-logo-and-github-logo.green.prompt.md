response_text: |
  I have made the requested changes to the navbar. I modified `frontend/docusaurus.config.js` to group the social icons and `frontend/src/css/custom.css` to apply more professional styling and reduce the spacing between the icons.
outcome: The navbar has been updated to appear more professional, with reduced spacing between the social media icons, and a more subtle hover effect. The Modules link also has improved spacing.
evaluation: The user's request for a more professional navbar and decreased spacing for social media icons was addressed by updating the Docusaurus configuration and custom CSS. The changes were implemented successfully, enhancing the visual appeal and consistency of the navigation bar.
