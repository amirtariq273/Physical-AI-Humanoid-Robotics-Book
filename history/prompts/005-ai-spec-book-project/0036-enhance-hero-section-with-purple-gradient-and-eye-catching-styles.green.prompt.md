  I have successfully updated the hero section styles.

  Now, I will prompt the user to start the development server to verify the changes.
outcome: The hero section has been updated with a vibrant purple gradient background, eye-catching text styles with shadows, and an interactive hover effect. These changes create a more modern and professional look for the main front of the website.
evaluation: The user's request for an eye-catching hero section with a purple theme was addressed by updating the custom CSS. The changes were implemented successfully, enhancing the visual appeal and interactivity of the hero section.
