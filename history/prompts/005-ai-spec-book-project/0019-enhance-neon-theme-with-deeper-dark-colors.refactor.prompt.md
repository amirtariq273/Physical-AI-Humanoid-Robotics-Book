## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Deepened the dark aesthetic of the neon theme by adjusting background, surface, code block, and border colors to be darker, ensuring existing vibrant accents remain.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were run. Manual verification by starting Docusaurus server is required.
- 📁 Files: `frontend/src/css/custom.css` (modified).
- 🔁 Next prompts: User will verify the changes.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully applied specific color adjustments to enhance the dark theme without altering the core neon aesthetic or layout, as requested.
