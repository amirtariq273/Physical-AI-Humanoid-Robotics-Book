## Prompt

yes with good neon theme

## Response snapshot

Successfully overwrote file: C:\Users\Aamir Tariq\Desktop\AI BOOK BY HUMAN\frontend\src\css\custom.css.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Applied a new, comprehensive "neon theme" to the Docusaurus project by overwriting `custom.css` with dark backgrounds, vibrant accents, and specific styling for various components.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were run. Manual verification by starting Docusaurus server is required.
- 📁 Files: `frontend/src/css/custom.css` (modified).
- 🔁 Next prompts: User will verify the changes.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully implemented a major aesthetic refactoring based on the user's request for a "neon theme."
